### Notebooks on scientific computing with CUDA (and Python)
============================================================

A set of IPython notebooks on how to use  CUDA with Python to solve some problems.
Files are organised following a structure that I got from [Carl Boettiger's Lab Notebooks](khttp://carlboettiger.info/lab-notebook.html): a project has a DESCRIPTION with the metadata, a README.md with this information, a python_nb dir where most of the work is in the form of IPython notebooks; a src directory has additional code that is used in the notebooks.

To open these notebooks in IPython, download the files in the `python_nb` to a directory on your computer and from that directory run:

    $ ipython notebook

This will open a new page in your browser with a list of the available notebooks (see below).
